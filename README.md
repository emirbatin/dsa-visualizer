# Data Structure & Algorithm Visualizer

Data Structure Visualizer is an interactive educational tool developed to help you better understand the principles of data structures and algorithms. By visually explaining complex data structures and algorithms, this app makes learning more fun and understandable for computer science students and enthusiasts.



## Algorithms

- Stack Create the stack structure visually and watch animated insertions (push) and removals (pop).
- Sorting: Visualize popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort step by step.
- Linked List: Visually experience the insertion, deletion and navigation of linked lists.
- Binary Tree: Explore node insertion, deletion and tree traversal by visualizing Binary Tree structures.
* Future Updates: More algorithms and data structures will be added in the future.
